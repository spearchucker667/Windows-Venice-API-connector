## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added README release ribbon and badges for CI, Windows release, latest GitHub release, license, Node support, TypeScript strict mode, Electron, and Venice API.
- Added `docs/REPOSITORY_TREE.md` with a public repository map and segment ownership notes.
- Added `docs/LEGAL.md` with Venice.ai TOS/privacy/API links, affiliation notice, API key handling notes, and release disclaimers.
- Added root `SECURITY.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, GitHub issue templates, pull request template, and Dependabot configuration.

### Changed
- Updated all supporting documentation to match the current app status and public release process.
- Windows release workflow now generates and uploads SHA-256 checksum sidecar files for `.exe` artifacts.
- Updated `metadata.json` to describe Venice Forge instead of the previous empty/generated metadata.

### Security
- Documented web proxy forbidden-header stripping and proxy-root rejection.
- Added Venice.ai TOS, privacy, and API documentation coverage for public releases.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-20

### Security
- **SEC-001:** Added `/augment/search`, `/augment/scrape`, `/augment/text-parser` to the IPC and web-proxy endpoint allowlist. These endpoints were previously blocked, making the Research tab non-functional in both Electron and web modes.
- **SEC-002:** Added `safeHref()` sanitization to search result anchor tags. Only `http:` and `https:` scheme URLs are allowed; `javascript:`, `data:`, and other schemes are replaced with `#` to prevent XSS.
- **SEC-003 (web proxy):** Added security response headers — `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`, and `Content-Security-Policy` — to all web-proxy responses.

### Fixed
- **BUG-001:** `galleryFilename` was called with a plain string instead of the item object in bulk gallery download, producing `venice-undefined-undefined.png` filenames for all downloads.
- **BUG-002:** Import backup was constructed in memory but never written to disk before import records were applied, misleading the user with a "backup prepared" message.
- **BUG-003:** Removed dead `const endedAt = nowIso()` variable captured before `fetch()` was called in `veniceClient.ts`.

### Changed
- `upscaleGalleryImage` now accepts a `model` parameter (default `"upscale-model"`); `GalleryModule` passes `state.selectedImageModel` so the currently selected model is used.
- `app.set("trust proxy", 1)` added to Express; removed deprecated `req.connection.remoteAddress` fallback so rate limiting uses the correct client IP behind a reverse proxy.
- Excluded `vite.config.ts` and test files from `tsconfig.json`; `npm run typecheck` now exits with zero errors.

### Added
- 25 new tests across `server.test.ts`, `src/utils/image.test.ts`, `src/utils/markdown.test.ts` — total 41 tests (was 16). Coverage includes: augment endpoint validation, rate limiter enforcement, security header assertions, `galleryFilename` regression guard, `normalizeImageData`, `extractImages`, markdown XSS safety, and `escapeHtml`.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-20

### Added

**Core features**
- Dual-mode application: Electron desktop (Windows) and Vite/Express web development mode.
- **Prompt tab:** Streaming chat completions with system-prompt control, model selection, stop/abort, and conversation history stored in IndexedDB.
- **Create tab:** Single and batch image generation with configurable dimensions, steps, guidance scale, negative prompt, seed, and watermark control. One-click upscaling via Venice upscale endpoint. Images saved to local gallery.
- **Batch tab:** Run one prompt across multiple inputs, or run many prompts in sequence, with live progress, abort, and per-result download.
- **Research tab:** Venice-augmented web search (Brave, Google, DuckDuckGo providers), page scraping, and document text extraction via Venice augment endpoints.
- **Catalog tab:** Live Venice model browser showing model ID, type, traits, and capabilities; falls back to built-in model list on network error.
- **Library tab:** Local image gallery with individual download, upscale, delete, and bulk-download (up to 50 images at a time).
- **Config tab:** API key save/test/delete (desktop), theme selection, image/chat model defaults, JSON data import/export with schema validation and ID-merge (not overwrite).
- **Status tab:** Diagnostics panel showing transport mode, runtime/app versions, storage info, API key state, rate-limit headers, and one-click log folder access.

**Architecture and security**
- Electron main process with strict IPC validation (`validateVeniceIpcRequest`), sandboxed renderer, context isolation, and preload bridge (`window.veniceForge`).
- API key stored via Electron `safeStorage`; plaintext fallback disabled unless `VENICE_FORGE_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_KEY_STORAGE=true`.
- Restrictive production CSP; navigation blocked to non-app URLs; external HTTPS links open in OS browser.
- Express web proxy with endpoint allowlist, method validation, rate limiting, circuit breaker, and `express.raw` body passthrough.
- Log redaction for authorization headers, API keys, bearer tokens, and secret-like field values.
- Versioned JSON export/import with size validation, store validation, and secret field stripping.

**Developer experience**
- TypeScript strict mode throughout renderer and Electron main.
- Vitest test suite with supertest integration tests for the Express proxy.
- CI matrix (Node 20 + 22) via GitHub Actions.
- Windows release workflow with NSIS installer and portable exe, upload to GitHub Releases.
- Placeholder icon generation and verification scripts.
- `npm run clean`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run verify:dist` convenience scripts.
- `.env.example` with all configurable environment variables documented.
