# Venice Forge - Current Backlog

> Updated: 2026-05-22  
> Scope: Public repository readiness, release quality, security, accessibility, and integration follow-ups.

This backlog reflects the current repository state. Completed items from earlier audits have been removed or moved into the changelog.

## Public Readiness

| PUB-006 | P1 | Done | Dependabot metadata | See `.github/dependabot.yml`. |
| PUB-007 | P1 | Open | Replace generated placeholder icon before broad public promotion | `build/icon.ico` is valid for packaging but still placeholder artwork. |

## Release

| ID | Priority | Status | Item | Notes |
|----|----------|--------|------|-------|
| REL-001 | P0 | Done | Windows release workflow builds NSIS and portable artifacts | See `.github/workflows/windows-release.yml`. |

| REL-006 | P2 | Done | Add auto-update strategy | Added electron-updater and GitHub Releases integration. |

## Security and Privacy

| ID | Priority | Status | Item | Notes |
|----|----------|--------|------|-------|
| SEC-001 | P0 | Done | Shared endpoint allowlist for IPC and web proxy | `src/shared/validation.ts`. |
| SEC-002 | P0 | Done | Web proxy rejects proxy root and disallowed endpoints | `server.ts`, `server.test.ts`. |
| SEC-003 | P0 | Done | Web proxy strips renderer-controlled forbidden headers | `server.ts`, `server.test.ts`. |
| SEC-004 | P1 | Done | Root private vulnerability reporting instructions | `SECURITY.md` updated: GitHub private reporting link, supported versions, and `npm audit` gate documented. |
| SEC-005 | P1 | Open | Run dependency audit before each public release | `npm audit` last run clean (0 vulnerabilities, 2026-05-21). Re-run before every release. |
| SEC-006 | P2 | Done | Add runtime validation for Venice API response shapes | `src/utils/veniceValidation.ts` — validators for `/models`, `/image/generate`, `/image/upscale`, `/chat/completions`, `/augment/search`. Integrated into `modelService.ts`, `imageWorkflowService.ts`, and `SearchScrapeModule.tsx`. 26 tests. Extended to cover `dataUrl`/`dataBase64` binary PNG shapes from upscale endpoint. |

## Accessibility and UX

| ID | Priority | Status | Item | Notes |
|----|----------|--------|------|-------|
| A11Y-001 | P1 | Done | Modal focus trapping and keyboard flows | `ImageActionModal.tsx`: Tab cycling and Escape were already in place. Added return-focus: captures `document.activeElement` before opening, restores it on close. |
| A11Y-002 | P1 | Done | Toast and error announcements in screen readers | `ToastHost` uses `role="alert"` + `aria-live="assertive"` for errors and `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"` for info/success. `StatusBlock` mirrors the same pattern. No changes required. |
| A11Y-003 | P2 | Done | Captions/labels on diagnostics tables | Only one `<table>` exists in the codebase (`DiagnosticsModule`); it already carries `<caption className="sr-only">Venice API response headers</caption>`. No changes required. |
| UX-001 | P2 | Done | Progress/cancel affordance for bulk gallery download | `imageWorkflowService.ts`: `downloadAllGallery` now accepts `onProgress` and `cancelSignal` options. `GalleryModule.tsx`: toolbar shows live `Saving N/M…` counter and a **Cancel** button while a bulk download is in progress. |

## Integration

| ID | Priority | Status | Item | Notes |
|----|----------|--------|------|-------|
| API-001 | P1 | Open | Validate desktop support for file uploads through `/augment/text-parser` | Requires an Electron smoke test with a real Venice key. |
| API-002 | P1 | Done | Cache `/models` with stale-while-revalidate behavior | `modelService.ts`: cached models are served immediately (even when stale), with a background refresh triggered once the 5-minute TTL expires. Background refresh errors are swallowed silently when a cache hit was already dispatched. |
| API-003 | P2 | Open | Consider additional Venice endpoints | Embeddings, audio, image edit, and usage endpoints are not currently allowlisted. |
| API-004 | P1 | Done | Venice API full spec alignment | Completed review of full Swagger YAML + LLM info docs. Fixes: (1) `normalizeError` now covers 404 (`model/resource not found`) and 413 (`payload too large`); (2) `/image/upscale` request body no longer sends `model` or `return_binary` — both are outside the `additionalProperties: false` schema; (3) upscale binary PNG responses (`{ dataUrl }` web, `{ dataBase64 }` Electron) handled correctly in `isValidImageResponse`, `extractImages`, and `normalizeImageData`; (4) `x-ratelimit-type`, `x-venice-model-deprecation-date`, and all content safety headers tracked in diagnostics. `?type=all` query param on `/models` confirmed valid. |

## Bug Fixes (Session)

| ID | Priority | Status | Item | Notes |
|----|----------|--------|------|-------|
| BUG-004 | P0 | Done | `enable_web_search` sent as boolean instead of string enum | `payloadBuilders.ts`: now passes string value directly (`"off"` default). Root cause of all `/chat/completions` HTTP 400s. |
| BUG-005 | P0 | Done | Venice `DetailedError` (Zod) not parsed — fell through to "Unknown Venice API error" | `src/services/veniceClient.ts` + `electron/services/veniceClient.ts`: both now extract `details._errors` and field-level errors. |
| BUG-006 | P1 | Done | Every failed request produced two diagnostic log entries | `veniceFetchDesktop` now sets the error message in the initial dispatch; catch block skips re-dispatch when `err.diagnostics` is set. |
| BUG-007 | P0 | Done | Legacy boolean `webSearch` values could still produce invalid chat payloads | `appReducer.ts` now coerces legacy boolean/imported values to valid enum strings (`off`/`on`/`auto`), and `buildChatPayload` enforces the same normalization before sending. |
| BUG-008 | P1 | Done | Electron text-parser FormData uploads were not using serialized IPC payload | `veniceFetchDesktop` now sends `serializedBody` across IPC for `isFormData` requests, restoring reliable `/augment/text-parser` uploads in desktop mode. |
| BUG-009 | P2 | Done | Web transport showed duplicate diagnostics and weak schema-error parsing on non-2xx responses | Web path in `veniceClient.ts` now parses Venice `DetailedError` format and avoids catch-path re-dispatch when an HTTP diagnostics entry already exists. |

## Deep Scan Findings

> Deep scan performed: 2026-05-21. All items verified against source. Severity: **Major** = functional breakage or security gap, **Medium** = degraded reliability or incorrect behavior under specific conditions, **Minor** = cosmetic, dead code, or sub-optimal patterns.

| ID | Severity | Status | Item | Notes |
|----|----------|--------|------|-------|
| DSC-001 | Major | Done | **Search result links non-functional in Electron desktop mode** — `isTrustedExternalUrl` in `electron/main.ts` restricted external links to a small hostname allowlist, blocking search result clicks. | Fixed: `isTrustedExternalUrl` now allows any `https:` URL to open via `shell.openExternal`. |
| DSC-002 | Medium | Done | **Web streaming error extraction drops structured error details** — `veniceStreamChat` web path passed raw text to `normalizeError`, bypassing structured Zod/DetailedError parsing. | Fixed: response text is now JSON-parsed and routed through `readWebErrorBody` before `normalizeError`. |
| DSC-003 | Medium | Done | **Bulk download aborts on single-item failure** — `downloadAllGallery` lacked per-item error handling. | Fixed: per-item `try/catch` wraps `downloadImage`; failures are counted and reported in the summary toast. |
| DSC-004 | Medium | Done | **File IPC handlers lack filesystem error trapping** — `app:saveJsonFile` and `app:loadJsonFile` had no try/catch around filesystem calls. | Fixed: both handlers now catch errors and return `{ ok: false, error: sanitizeError(err) }`. |
| DSC-005 | Minor | Done | **`galleryFilename` called with wrong arguments in GalleryModule** — passed `(item.prompt, item.timestamp)` instead of `(item)`. | Fixed: both call sites now pass the full item object. |
| DSC-006 | Minor | Done | **StatusBlock hides success when error is also set** — early return on error suppressed concurrent success. | Fixed: component now renders both error and success blocks independently using a fragment. |
| DSC-007 | Minor | Done | **Cleared chat injects phantom assistant message into API context** — placeholder `"Conversation cleared."` message was sent to the API. | Fixed: `clear()` sets messages to `[]` and delivers feedback via toast instead. |
| DSC-008 | Minor | Done | **Chat prompt field shows validation error on first blur** — `onBlur` set `promptTouched` before any submit attempt. | Fixed: removed `onBlur` handler; `promptTouched` is only set on submit. |
| DSC-009 | Minor | Done | **Batch cancellation leaves active task stuck in "running" state** — `cancel()` didn't update in-flight task status. | Fixed: `cancel()` now transitions all `"running"` results to `"cancelled"` before clearing `isRunning`. |
| DSC-010 | Minor | Done | **Dead code: `ab2str` and `str2ab` in cryptoService** — unused helper functions. | Fixed: both functions removed. |
| DSC-011 | Minor | Done | **TextEncoder allocation overhead in `byteLength`** — `new TextEncoder().encode(value).length` allocated a full copy. | Fixed: replaced with `new Blob([value]).size`. |

## Verification Commands


```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm run verify:icon
npm run dist:win
npm run verify:dist
```

When working from a shell without `npm` on `PATH`, use the bundled Node runtime directly for TypeScript, Vitest, Vite, esbuild, and local scripts.
