# Windows Release Checklist

## Version

1. Update `version` in `package.json`.
2. Run `npm install` so `package-lock.json` stays in sync.
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version section.
4. Confirm `README.md`, [LEGAL.md](LEGAL.md), [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), [REPOSITORY_TREE.md](REPOSITORY_TREE.md), and this checklist match the release.
5. Confirm public-facing badges and GitHub templates still point at `spearchucker667/Test-ai`.

## Local Build

Run on Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
npm run clean
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm run dist:win
npm run verify:dist
```

Expected artifacts:

- `release/Venice-Forge-<version>-x64-Setup.exe`
- `release/Venice-Forge-<version>-x64-Portable.exe`
- `release/Venice-Forge-<version>-x64-Setup.exe.sha256`
- `release/Venice-Forge-<version>-x64-Portable.exe.sha256`

## Signing

Signing is optional for local development. For distribution, configure electron-builder-compatible signing with one of:

- `CSC_LINK` and `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`
- `WIN_CSC_LINK` and `WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`

Do not commit certificates or passwords. If signing variables are missing, builds are unsigned and Windows SmartScreen may warn users.

## GitHub Actions

Use `.github/workflows/windows-release.yml`.

Triggers:

- Manual `workflow_dispatch`
- Version tags matching `v*`

The workflow runs `npm ci`, typecheck, tests, build, `dist:win`, `verify:dist`, and uploads `release/*.exe`.

It also generates SHA-256 checksum sidecar files for each `.exe` artifact and uploads them with the release artifact bundle.

## Smoke Test

- [ ] Fresh launch routes to API key setup when no key exists.
- [ ] Save, test, and delete API key.
- [ ] Invalid key returns a clean `401`/`403` style message.
- [ ] Model refresh succeeds after a valid key is saved.
- [ ] Chat and image generation work.
- [ ] Batch run completes successfully.
- [ ] Research (web search, scrape, text-parser) returns results.
- [ ] Export data creates versioned JSON without secrets.
- [ ] Import validates and merges data without clearing existing records; pre-import backup saved to disk.
- [ ] Copy diagnostics redacts secrets.
- [ ] Open logs folder works.
- [ ] Setup installer installs and uninstalls without deleting user data.
- [ ] Portable exe launches without installation.
- [ ] SHA-256 checksum files match the final uploaded `.exe` files.
- [ ] Release notes state whether artifacts are signed or unsigned.
- [ ] Legal/TOS notes in [LEGAL.md](LEGAL.md) still link to current Venice pages.

## Publish

1. Create a tag: `git tag v<version> && git push origin v<version>`.
2. Download artifacts from the workflow or use local `release/`.
3. Smoke test on a clean Windows VM.
4. Upload artifacts and checksums to the release.
5. Note whether artifacts are signed or unsigned.
6. Update the GitHub Release notes from `CHANGELOG.md`.
