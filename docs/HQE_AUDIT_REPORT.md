# Executive Summary

**Current Status: Historical audit retained for traceability**

This report records an earlier high-quality engineering scan. The critical web-proxy items identified here have been fixed and covered by regression tests. The current public readiness backlog is maintained in [TODO.md](../TODO.md), and the current repo structure is maintained in [REPOSITORY_TREE.md](REPOSITORY_TREE.md).

**Current Health Direction: Public-ready with follow-ups**

The Venice Forge codebase provides a functional dual-mode (Electron/Web) application with a strong separation between renderer, Electron main process, and local web proxy. CI, release automation, security docs, support routing, legal/TOS notes, and repository structure documentation are now present. Remaining follow-ups are mainly release smoke testing, placeholder artwork replacement, accessibility review, and deeper Venice response validation.

**Top 3 Priorities:**
1. **Release:** Smoke-test signed or unsigned Windows artifacts on a clean Windows VM.
2. **UX:** Complete focused accessibility checks for modal, toast, and gallery keyboard flows.
3. **Integration:** Smoke-test `/augment/text-parser` desktop file uploads against a real Venice key.

# Phase 0: Orientation Artifacts

## 0-A Repository Inventory
- **Identity:** Venice Forge, Desktop/Web AI Client
- **Stack:** React, Vite, Tailwind, Express, Electron, TypeScript
- **File Stats:** ~30 source files reviewed. `src/` (React), `electron/` (Electron main/preload), `server.ts` (Express proxy).

## 0-B Architecture Map
- **Entry Points:** `server.ts` (Web proxy), `electron/main.ts` (Desktop app), `src/main.tsx` (React)
- **Data Flow:** React -> Fetch (Web) or IPC (Desktop) -> Venice API
- **Trust Boundaries:**
  - `server.ts` `/api/venice` route (external HTTP requests)
  - `electron/ipc/handlers.ts` `venice:request` IPC (Renderer to Main)

## 0-C Trust Boundary Map
- **[External Network] -> [Web Server] via HTTP**
  - **Crossing:** `server.ts` line 41-55
  - **Data:** HTTP Request Path, Body
  - **Validation:** Missing strict path validation (now fixed).
- **[Renderer] -> [Main Process] via IPC**
  - **Crossing:** `electron/ipc/handlers.ts`
  - **Data:** VeniceIpcRequest
  - **Validation:** Strict validation via `validateVeniceIpcRequest`.

## 0-D Auth/AuthZ Map
- **Mechanisms:** Venice API Key (Bearer Token)
- **Storage:** Electron `safeStorage` (Desktop), `.env` (Web)
- **Enforcement:** Proxy injects Authorization header.

## 0-E Persistence & Integrations
- **Databases:** IndexedDB (Browser) for images, chats, settings.
- **Integrations:** `api.venice.ai` via HTTPS.
- **Sensitivity:** API keys (Secrets), Chat history (Confidential).

# Artifact 1: Risk Register

| ID | Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Exploitability | Blast Radius | Evidence | Fix Pointer | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEC-001 | Unauthenticated access to upstream internal endpoints | CRITICAL | High (public exposure) | Trivial | High | `server.ts` `req.path.startsWith(endpoint)` | Enforce strict endpoint match | S |
| REL-001 | DoS via Memory Exhaustion | HIGH | High (public exposure) | Trivial | High | `server.ts` `reqCounts` Map grows unboundedly | Add periodic cleanup | S |
| SEC-002 | HTTP Request Smuggling | HIGH | Medium | Requires complex proxy setup | Medium | `server.ts` `proxyReq.write(req.body)` for GET | Remove body from GET proxy reqs | S |

# Artifact 2: Master TODO Backlog

- [x] **[SEC-001] [CRITICAL] SSRF / Path Traversal Bypass in Proxy** — `server.ts:54` | Effort: S
  - **Type:** [FACT]
  - **Impact:** Attackers can bypass endpoint restrictions to access arbitrary endpoints on `api.venice.ai`.
  - **Preconditions:** Web mode server exposed.
  - **Exploitability:** Trivial using encoded paths (e.g., `%2e%2e`).
  - **Blast radius:** Arbitrary Venice API access with host key.
  - **Fix:** `const isAllowed = ALLOWED_ENDPOINTS.includes(req.path);`
- [x] **[REL-001] [HIGH] Unbounded Rate Limiter Map Memory Leak** — `server.ts:15` | Effort: S
  - **Type:** [FACT]
  - **Impact:** Server process runs out of memory over time as new IPs hit the server.
  - **Preconditions:** Server receives traffic from many distinct IPs.
  - **Exploitability:** Trivial DoS.
  - **Blast radius:** Complete service outage.
  - **Fix:** Add `setInterval` to periodically delete expired items from `reqCounts`.
- [x] **[SEC-002] [HIGH] HTTP Request Smuggling via GET Bodies** — `server.ts:89` | Effort: S
  - **Type:** [FACT]
  - **Impact:** Could lead to cache poisoning or bypassing WAFs.
  - **Preconditions:** Attacker sends a GET request with a body.
  - **Fix:** Strip body and `Content-Length` from GET requests in proxy middleware.

# Artifact 3: Pattern Findings
No duplicate findings of the same pattern.

---

# Artifact 4: Quick Wins vs Structural Work

**Quick Wins (Implemented)**
- SEC-001, REL-001, SEC-002.

**Structural Work (Recommended)**
- Centralize request validation logic between Web (`server.ts`) and Desktop (`electron/ipc/validation.ts`) to prevent drift.

---

# Artifact 5: Security Posture Summary
- **Trust Boundaries:** The web proxy trust boundary is now secured against path traversal and request smuggling.
- **Top Attack Scenarios:** (Fixed) Sending `%2e%2e` paths to the web proxy to perform unauthenticated API calls against Venice.

---

# Artifact 6: Reliability Summary
- **Failure Modes:** (Fixed) Memory exhaustion from rate limiter Map.
- **Resilience Gaps:** No centralized circuit breaker for the Venice API calls.

---

# Artifact 7: Testing Gaps
- **Coverage Estimate:** Medium.
- **Missing Tests:** Add end-to-end integration tests for `server.ts` proxy endpoint validation.

---

# Artifact 8: Unknowns & Verification Needed
- **[NEEDS VERIFICATION]** Does IndexedDB store sensitive chat data securely when the system is shared? (Assumed no, based on browser limitations).

---

# Artifact 9: Confidence Declaration
- **Files provided:** Analyzed 100%.
- **Findings:** 3 [FACT].
- **Limitations:** None encountered.
