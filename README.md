For development, see [Development](#-development) or [docs/ABOUT.md](docs/ABOUT.md) for architecture details.

---

## ✨ Features

Eight integrated tabs covering chat, image generation, batch automation, research, and settings:

| Tab | Name | What You Can Do |
|-----|------|-----------------|
| 💬 | **Chat** | Multi-turn streaming conversations with system prompts, file/image attachments, memory injection, persistent history, and chat forking |
| 🖼️ | **Create** | Single and batch image generation with AI upscaling and local gallery management |
| 📋 | **Batch** | Automate: run one prompt across many inputs, or chain multiple prompts in sequence |
| 🔍 | **Research** | Web search via Venice or Jina AI, page scraping, research synthesis, and public-profile discovery |
| 📚 | **Catalog** | Browse live Venice model catalog with capability details; auto-refresh on API key save |
| 🏞️ | **Library** | Local image library with download, upscale, export, and conversation history |
| ⚙️ | **Config** | API key management, theme editor (Forge Graphite, Daylight, Copper), model defaults, data import/export |
| 📊 | **Diagnostics** | Transport mode, runtime info, rate-limit headers, and log viewer |

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Desktop & Web Dual-Mode:**
- **Electron desktop app** (Windows/macOS) — React renderer + Electron IPC + main-process HTTPS client
- **Web mode** (development/self-hosted) — React renderer + Express proxy server
- **Unified Venice API layer** — all traffic goes through validated, safety-checked paths

**Security-first design:**
- Renderer cannot access raw API keys (stored in OS Keychain/DPAPI)
- Content safety guard on every outgoing request (Venice-approved endpoints only)
- Encrypted IndexedDB storage, secure chat history snapshots, trusted URL validation
- Zero telemetry, no external analytics

See [docs/ABOUT.md](docs/ABOUT.md) for detailed architecture and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full security model.

---

## 📋 Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| **Node.js** | 20 or 22 |
| **npm** | 10+ |

| `npm run clean` | Remove all generated output |

### Environment Variables (Web Mode Only)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
# Required
VENICE_API_KEY="your-venice-inference-key"

# Optional
PORT=3000                              # Server port (default: 3000)
HOST=127.0.0.1                         # Bind address (default: 127.0.0.1)
NODE_ENV=development                   # development | production | test
VENICE_FORGE_DEBUG_DEVTOOLS=false      # Allow DevTools in production
VENICE_FORGE_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_KEY_STORAGE=false  # Linux plaintext fallback (⚠️ security warning)
```

For the full list of env vars and their purposes, see `.env.example`.

---

## 📦 Building & Packaging

### Windows Packaging

```bash
npm run dist:win
npm run checksum:release
npm run verify:dist:win
```

Outputs to `release/`:
- `Venice-Forge-<version>-x64-Setup.exe` — NSIS installer
- `Venice-Forge-<version>-x64-Portable.exe` — standalone portable executable

### macOS Packaging

```bash
npm run dist:mac
npm run checksum:release
npm run verify:dist:mac
```

Outputs to `release/`:
- `Venice-Forge-<version>-arm64.dmg` / `.zip` — Apple Silicon bundle
- `Venice-Forge-<version>-x64.dmg` / `.zip` — Intel bundle

### Signing & Notarization

- **Local builds:** Unsigned; may trigger SmartScreen (Windows) or Gatekeeper (macOS) warnings
- **Official releases:** Signed via Apple Developer ID (macOS) and Windows code signing (Windows)
- **macOS Gatekeeper workaround (local builds):** `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/path/to/Venice Forge.app"`

For detailed signing and notarization steps, see [docs/RELEASE/signing-and-notarization.md](docs/RELEASE/signing-and-notarization.md).

**Icon Resources:** Build icons (`build/icon.ico`, `build/icon.icns`, `build/icon.png`) are required for packaging. This repo includes placeholder icons; run `npm run generate:icon` if missing, then replace with final artwork before release.

## 💾 Data Storage & Privacy

| Data Type | Location | Encryption |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **API Keys** (Desktop) | OS Keychain (macOS) / DPAPI (Windows) | OS-level (encrypted at rest) |
| **Logs** | Application support dir | Plain text (disk only) |
| **Chats** (Desktop) | `chat-history/*.json` | Plain text (encryption planned) |
| **Settings, Images, Conversations** | Renderer IndexedDB | AES-GCM (browser-managed key) |
| **Exports** | User-specified location | Versioned JSON (same as storage) |

**Import/Export Notes:**
- Validation: JSON schema and size checks (max 25 MB)
- Merging: By ID (never clears existing data)
- Privacy: Secret-like fields are automatically stripped before export
- Safety: A backup is always saved before import

**Web Mode Only:** API keys are never stored locally; they live in `.env` on the server and are not accessible to the renderer.

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

**Core Security Principles:**
1. **API key isolation** — Renderer cannot access raw keys (stored in OS secure storage)
2. **Venice endpoint allowlist** — Only 7 approved Venice endpoints are callable
3. **Content safety guard** — Every outgoing request is scanned for unsafe content before leaving the app
4. **No telemetry** — Venice Forge collects zero analytics or tracking data
5. **Trusted URL validation** — External links must be HTTPS with non-private hostnames

**Content Safety:**
- Advanced context detection and `negative_prompt` extraction
- Scanned at: renderer layer, Electron IPC layer, and Express proxy
- Fail-close design: errors result in 500 status (safe default)
- Raw prompt text is never logged anywhere

**For full details**, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

---

## 🎨 Theming

Venice Forge includes a full token-based theme system:

- **3 built-in palettes:** Forge Graphite, Forge Daylight, Forge Copper
- **Live theme editor:** Open **Config** → **Appearance** → **Theme Maker** to customize in real time
- **Persistent storage:** Custom themes are saved to encrypted IndexedDB and persist across sessions

See [docs/THEME_SYSTEM.md](docs/THEME_SYSTEM.md) for complete theming guide and token reference.

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Missing icon** | `npm run generate:icon && npm run verify:icon` |
| **Packaging fails** | `npm run clean && npm install && npm run build && npm run dist:win` |
| **SmartScreen/Gatekeeper warning** | Expected for unsigned local builds; sign before release |
| **No API key prompt** | Manually open **Config**, save a key, test connection |
| **Chat history not loading** | Check chat-history folder (see Storage section); corrupted files are backed up as `.backup-{timestamp}` |
| **`400` on chat/image requests** | Verify model ID is valid and all parameters are correct strings |
| **`401` / `403` errors** | Check that your API key is valid and has proper scope |
| **`429` rate limit** | Wait for reset period (shown in **Diagnostics** tab) |
| **Transport/connection failure** | Open **Diagnostics**, copy debug info, check logs folder |
